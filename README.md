# Aurum

**Under Construction** ðŸ¤—

Eventually, this may be a wrapper for the coinbase API written in Elixir.  Though this repository was made with the eventual goal of providing a comprehensive interface, it's currently more of a fun project to practice things such as HMAC authentication without any hand holding from other libraries.  Presently the interesting bits of this project reside in [`lib/request.ex`](https://github.com/alex0112/aurum/blob/master/lib/request.ex).

Feel free to poke around.
