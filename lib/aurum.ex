  Aurum is an Elixir Client for the Coinbase API.

  > If gold rusts, what then can iron do?
  > â€• Geoffrey Chaucer, The Canterbury Tales 

  ## Installation

  If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
  by adding `aurum` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

  ```elixir
  def deps do
    [
      {:aurum, "~> 0.2.0"}
    ]
  end
  ```

  ## Usage: 

  ### API Key/Secret
  First, ensure that you have a coinbase API Key, and an API Secret. Details about how to obtain those can be found in the [Coinbase Documentation](https://developers.coinbase.com/docs/wallet/api-key-authentication).

  Once you have obtained them, make sure that they are in the environment your module will be running in under the names `COINBASE_KEY` and `COINBASE_SECRET`:
  ```bash
  $ export COINBASE_KEY=...
  $ export COINBASE_SECRET=...
  ```

  This will enable the client library to correctly sign your requests.

  ### Making requests to the API:
  To use the client, alias `Coinbase` into your module:

  ```elixir
  defmodule MyModule do
    alias Aurum.Coinbase

    ...

  end
  ```

  ### Basic Usage:
  Once you have access to the `Coinbase` module, you can begin making any of the requests outlined in [the documentation](https://developers.coinbase.com/api/v2#introduction) for V2 of the Coinbase API. All of the authentication steps should be completed automatically provided the `COINBASE_KEY` and `COINBASE_SECRET` are properly set. All calls to the API should follow the pathing scheme of `/v2/<resource path>`. 

  For example:

  ```elixir
  def fetch_btc_account do
    Coinbase.get("/v2/accounts/btc")
  end
  ```

  Sucessful responses are always in the form of:
  ```elixir
  %{
    "data" => %{
      ...
    },
    "warnings" => [ ## If any
      
    ]
  }
  ```

  And for any HTTP verbs that require a body (i.e. PUT/PATCH/POST), the body may be defined as a bare map:
  ```elixir
  Coinbase.post("/v2/...", %{amount: 10, currency: "USD"})
  ```

  ...or as a valid JSON string:
  ```elixir
  Coinbase.post("/v2/...", ~S({"amount": "10", "currency": "USD"}))
  ```

  ### Example: Buy $10.00 worth of Ethereum
  ```elixir
  iex(1)> alias Aurum.Coinbase
  Aurum.Coinbase
  iex(2)> eth_account = Coinbase.get("/v2/accounts/eth")
  %{
    "data" => %{

    },
  }
  ```

  ## Known issues:
  You may see this warning pop up from time to time:
  ```
  17:55:32.021 [warn]  Description: 'Authenticity is not established by certificate path validation'
  Reason: 'Option {verify, verify_peer} and cacertfile/cacerts is missing'
  ```

  This is due to some configuration problems with the underlying HTTP client, and will be adressed in a future update.
